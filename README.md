# TomTom group member arrow

A TomTom Crazy Arrow will point and show distance to your fellow players in same party or raid as you.
This only works in the open world, Blizzard does not allow positioning inside dungeons and raids.

This is a continuation of the abandoned plugin [TomTomTargetArrow][old]

## Dependencies
As the name indicates, [TomTom][tomtom] must be installed for this addon to work.

[HereBeDragons][hbd] is used to aquire player positions and do distance calculations, but since TomTom also depends on it, there is no need to install it separately.


## Slash commands
`/ttta stick` will stick to your current target.

`/ttta unstick` will clear the sticky target and track the current target again.
